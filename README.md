# Hello! ðŸ‘‹

## This is a practice repo for my brain to brush up on a few things.

### Iâ€™m also banginâ€™ out this readme file in Markdown to refresh a few neurons.

Itâ€™s going surprisingly well! I thought Iâ€™d need a whole weekend to get back up to speed on the basics, but it only took a couple hours. 

I think Iâ€™ll take a break soon and go get some tacos!
